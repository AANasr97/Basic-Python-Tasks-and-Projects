    "The program uses object-oriented programming to create a banking system. There are two classes: the User class, which holds the user's details, and the Bank class, which stores information about the account balance and allows for deposits, withdrawals, and viewing the account balance.\n",
    "\n",
    "The main function starts by asking the user to enter their name, age, gender, ID, and password. If the user is new, the program creates an account for them and saves their information to a file called accounts.txt. If the user already has an account, the program loads their information from the file.\n",
    "\n",
    "The program then presents a menu of options to the user, including showing all account details, viewing the account balance, withdrawing money, depositing money, signing out, and exiting the program. The program prompts the user to enter their password before performing any action that modifies the account balance.\n",
    "\n",
    "If the user chooses to withdraw or deposit money, the program asks the user for the amount and performs the operation if the password is correct.\n",
    "\n",
    "If the user chooses to sign out, the program creates a new account for a different user or allows them to exit the program.\n",
    "\n",
    "The program uses exception handling to catch any input errors and prompt the user to try again.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, the program writes the updated account information back to the accounts.txt file when the user exits the program.\n",
    "\n",
    "That's a brief summary of the program."
